# Scraping-Wuzzuf.
In this project I create a web application where the user can search on IT/Software Development job opportunities in Egypt. The data is scraped from the website "Wuzzuf" which has limited abilities for filtering or doing some higher level aggregations on the job market size, top needed skills, and sectors for employment. Hence, this application will be used to provide more flexibility on that front.
